This portfolio project is an example of a company performance report in Power BI. It demonstrates the usage of switches to create simple, effective, dynamic functionality so that end users can quickly switch between 3 desired metrics (sales, gross profit, sales quantity) and drill into each to quickly identify area's of increased or decreased performance compared to the previous year.

The tree map provides a view of bottom 10 performing countries compared to PYTD performance.

The waterfall chart provides a month-by-month view of performance increases or decreases, and can be drilled into further to find details about specific countries and product categories and how they performed.

The scatterplot enables customer segmentation based on gross profit, enabling end users to quickly identify which segment of customers are above/below average gross profit to help determine which customer segments to focus on.
